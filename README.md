# Overview
A shell integrates a device model, application or other technology with CloudShell. A shell consists of a data model that defines how the device and its properties are modeled in CloudShell, along with automation that enables interaction with the device via CloudShell.

### Traffic Generator Shells
CloudShell's traffic generator shells enable you to conduct traffic test activities on Devices Under Test (DUT) or Systems Under Test (SUT) from a sandbox. In CloudShell, a traffic generator is typically modeled using a chassis resource, which represents the traffic generator device and ports, and a controller service that runs the chassis commands, such as Load Configuration File, Start Traffic and Get Statistics. Chassis and controllers are modeled by different shells, allowing you to accurately model your real-life architecture. For example, scenarios where the chassis and controller are located on different machines.

For additional information on traffic generator shell architecture, and setting up and using a traffic generator in CloudShell, see the [Traffic Generators Overview](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Trffc-Gens.htm?Highlight=traffic%20generator%20overview) online help topic.

### **Ixia IxNetwork Controller 2G Shell**
The **Ixia IxNetwork Controller 2G** shell provides you with connectivity and management capabilities such as device structure discovery and power management for the **Ixia IxNetwork Controller**. 

For more information on the **Ixia IxNetwork Controller**, see the official **Ixia** product documentation.

The **Ixia IxNetwork Controller** provides automation commands to run on the chassis, such as Load Configuration, Start/Stop Traffic, Get Statistics. For more information on the Ixia Chassis shell, see the following:

* [Ixia Chassis 2G Shell](https://community.quali.com/repos/3440/ixia-chassis-2-gen-shell)


### Standard version
The **Ixia IxNetwork Controller 2G** shell is based on the Traffic Generator Controller Standard version 2.0.0.

For detailed information about the shell’s structure and attributes, see the [Traffic Shell standard](https://github.com/QualiSystems/shell-traffic-standard/blob/master/spec/traffic_standard.md) in GitHub.

The **Client Install Path** attribute is not relevant for the Ixia IxNetwork Controller.

### Supported OS
▪ Windows

### Requirements

Release: **Ixia IxNetwork Controller 2G**

▪ IxNetwork API Server: 8.0.1 GA and above

▪ IxNetwork Connection Manager (Windows and Linux): 8.40 EA and above 

▪ CloudShell version: 8.3 GA Patch 3, 9.0 Patch 2, 9.1 GA and above

### Automation
This section describes the automation (driver) associated with the data model. The shell’s driver is provided as part of the shell package. There are two types of automation processes, Autoload and Resource.  Autoload is executed when creating the resource in the **Inventory** dashboard, while resource commands are run in the sandbox.

For Traffic Generator shells, commands are configured and executed from the controller service in the sandbox, with the exception of the Autoload command, which is executed when creating the resource.

|Command|Description|

## Importing and Configuring the Shell
This section describes how to import the Ixia IxNetwork Controller 2G shell and configure and modify the shell’s devices. 

### Importing the shell into CloudShell

**To import the shell into CloudShell:**
  1. Make sure you have the shell’s zip package. If not, download the shell from the [Quali Community's Integrations](https://community.quali.com/integrations) page.
  2. In CloudShell Portal, as Global administrator, open the **Manage – Shells** page.
  3. Click **Import**.
  4. In the dialog box, navigate to the shell's zip package, select it and click **Open**.

The service can now be added to a blueprint from the **Apps/Service** catalog's **Networking** category.  

### Offline installation of a shell

**Note:** Offline installation instructions are relevant only if CloudShell Execution Server has no access to PyPi. You can skip this section if your execution server has access to PyPi. For additional information, see the online help topic on offline dependencies.

In offline mode, import the shell into CloudShell and place any dependencies in the appropriate dependencies folder. The dependencies folder may differ, depending on the CloudShell version you are using:

* For CloudShell version 8.3 and above, see [Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#adding-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository).

* For CloudShell version 8.2, perform the appropriate procedure: [Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#adding-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository) or [Setting the python pythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key](#setting-the-python-pythonofflinerepositorypath-configuration-key).

* For CloudShell versions prior to 8.2, see [Setting the python pythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key](#setting-the-python-pythonofflinerepositorypath-configuration-key).

### Adding shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository
If your Quali Server and/or execution servers work offline, you will need to copy all required Python packages, including the out-of-the-box ones, to the PyPi Server's repository on the Quali Server computer (by default *C:\Program Files (x86)\QualiSystems\CloudShell\Server\Config\Pypi Server Repository*).

For more information, see [Configuring CloudShell to Execute Python Commands in Offline Mode](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=Configuring%20CloudShell%20to%20Execute%20Python%20Commands%20in%20Offline%20Mode).

**To add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository:**
  1. If you haven't created and configured the local PyPi Server repository to work with the execution server, perform the steps in [Add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository (offlinemode)](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=offline%20dependencies#Add). 
  
  2. For each shell or script you add into CloudShell, do one of the following (from an online computer):
      * Connect to the Internet and download each dependency specified in the *requirements.txt* file with the following command: 
`pip download -r requirements.txt`. 
     The shell or script's requirements are downloaded as zip files.

      * In the [Quali Community's Integrations](https://community.quali.com/integrations) page, locate the shell and click the shell's **Download** link. In the page that is displayed, from the Downloads area, extract the dependencies package zip file.

3. Place these zip files in the local PyPi Server repository.
 
### Setting the python PythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key
Before PyPi Server was introduced as CloudShell’s python package management mechanism, the `PythonOfflineRepositoryPath` key was used to set the default offline package repository on the Quali Server machine, and could be used on specific Execution Server machines to set a different folder. 

**To set the offline python repository:**
1. Download the *ixia_ixnetwork_controller_gen_2_offline_requirements.zip* file, see [Downloading the Shell](#downloading-the-shell).

2. Unzip it to a local repository. Make sure the execution server has access to this folder. 

3.  On the Quali Server machine, in the *~\CloudShell\Server\customer.config* file, add the following key to specify the path to the default python package folder (for all Execution Servers):  
	`<add key="PythonOfflineRepositoryPath" value="repository 
full path"/>`

4. If you want to override the default folder for a specific Execution Server, on the Execution Server machine, in the *~TestShell\Execution Server\customer.config* file, add the following key:  
	`<add key="PythonOfflineRepositoryPath" value="repository 
full path"/>`

5. Restart the Execution Server.
  
# Updating Python Dependencies for Shells
This section explains how to update your Python dependencies folder. This is required when you upgrade a shell that uses new/updated dependencies. It applies to both online and offline dependencies.

### Updating offline Python dependencies
**To update offline Python dependencies:**
1. Download the latest Python dependencies package zip file locally.

2. Extract the zip file to the suitable offline package folder(s). 

3. Terminate the shell’s instance, as explained [here](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Exctn-Srv-Exct.htm#Terminat). 

### Updating online Python dependencies
In online mode, the execution server automatically downloads and extracts the appropriate dependencies file to the online Python dependencies repository every time a new instance of the driver or script is created.

**To update online Python dependencies:**
* If there is a live instance of the shell's driver or script, terminate the shell’s instance, as explained [here](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Exctn-Srv-Exct.htm#Terminat). If an instance does not exist, the execution server will download the Python dependencies the next time a command of the driver or script runs.


## Associating a CloudShell Service to a Non-Global Domain

In order to expose a service to users of a domain that is not the Global domain, you must associate the service to the domain. To do this, you need to associate the service to a category that is assigned to the domain.

When you import a service shell, most shells are automatically assigned a default service category which is associated with the Global domain. For custom shells, this may not be true.

**To associate the Ixia IxNetwork Controller 2G service to a domain:**

**Note:** The association process differs depending on the type of shell - second generation (2G) shell or first generation (1G) shell. The instructions below detail the steps for a 2G service shell.

1. (Optional) To associate the service to a new service category(s): 

	**Note:** If you do not want to add a new category(s) to this shell, you can use the default category that comes out-of-the-box (if it exists).
	
	• Modify the *shelldefinition.yaml* file to add a service category(s) to the shell. See the CloudShell Developer Guide’s [Associating categories to a service shell](https://devguide.quali.com/shells/9.0.0/customizing-shells.html#associating-categories-to-a-service-shell) article. Note that when importing the shell into CloudShell, the new categories will be linked automatically with the Global domain.
	
2. Associate the shell’s service category (either the out-of-the-box category or the new category you created in step 1) to a non-Global domain.
	1. In the **Manage** dashboard, click **Categories** from the left sidebar, or **Domains** if you are a domain admin.
	
	2. Select **Services Categories**.
	
	3. Click the service category that is associated with your service shell.
	
	4. In the **Edit Category** dialog box, from the **Domains** drop-down list, select the desired domain(s).
	
	5. Click **Save**.

# Typical Workflow 

**Workflow 1** - *Using the IxNetwork controller to run IxNetwork traffic* 

1. In CloudShell Portal, in the top left section of the **Blueprint Catalog**, click **+ Create Blueprint**.

2. In the blueprint toolbar, click **Resource** and drag the Ixia Chassis resource into the diagram.

	1. Add the required number of Ixia Chassis resource ports to the blueprint. The number of Ixia Chassis resource ports in the blueprint should match the number of ports in the IxNetwork configuration. 
	For example: if you have a configuration with two ports:

# Release Notes 

For release updates, see the shell's [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/QualiSystems/Ixia-IxNetwork-Controller-Shell-2G/releases).

### Known Issues
• **Performance**: REST API performance is very poor. Loading a configuration and reserving ports may take a number of seconds, depending on your particular setup. You are advised to start idle connections on the Connection Manager to reduce startup time.

• **No available connection on the connection manager**: If there is no connection available on the Connection Manager, you must login to Connection Manager, close zombie connections or create new connections.

• **Licensing**: If the License server on the Connection Manager/API server is not configured, **Load Configuration** may run successfully, however the ports state will be Down and any further operations will fail.

• **Reserved ports**: If ports are reserved by other users, **Load Configuration** may run successfully, however the ports state will be Down and any further operations will fail.
